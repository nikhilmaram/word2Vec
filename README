In word2vec and glove, we generate an embedding space for the words.


run_word2vec : runs the word2vec file
run_glove    : runs the glove file.

The run file (run_word2vec, run_glove) assumes the following inputs:
1. text file : which contains the corpus
2. Dictionary file(vocab.txt) : which contains the dictionary words
3. vectors file(vectors.txt) : An output file, which contain the output embedding vectors.

The text file and dictionary file used for this are included.
